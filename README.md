gocamp
======

Dwarf Fortress clone written in go.


I am continuing to pursue my go education by building an open source [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) clone. I am naming it “gocamp” after the now defunct [Goblin Camp](http://www.goblincamp.com/). If anything useful ever comes of this project I may contact the Goblin Camp author for permission to formally adopt the name and / or use their assets.

The design docs should at some point be migrated to [the wiki](https://github.com/monban/gocamp/wiki).
