Dwarf Fortress clone written in go


I am continuing to pursue my go education by building an open source Dwarf Fortress clone. I am naming it “gocamp” after the now defunct [Goblin Camp](http://www.goblincamp.com/). If anything useful ever comes of this project I may contact the Goblin Camp author for permission to formally adopt the name and / or use their assets.
